# Cesarean Birth Predictor

This project involves creating an artificial intelligence model using Python 3 and the sklearn library to predict whether a person is likely to have a cesarean birth. The model is trained on a dataset of 80 individuals with cesarean birth records. By analyzing the provided information, the model can predict the suitability for cesarean delivery. This predictive tool aims to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding delivery methods, potentially improving patient outcomes and resource allocation.
